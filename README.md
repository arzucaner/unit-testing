# unit-testing

## Unit testing process utilizes the Jasmine framework and consists of three main components: 
Testing setup, test grouping using 'describe', data configuration, test skipping and focusing, the use of spies and mocks, debugging, and additional matches. 
These components are important for setting up and configuring the testing environment, grouping and organizing tests, handling data, skipping and focusing 
on specific tests, creating mock objects, debugging and identifying issues, and using additional matchers to improve the testing process.
